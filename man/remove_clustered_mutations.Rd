\title{Remove closely clustered mutations}
\usage{
remove_clustered_mutations(mutation_data)
}
\arguments{
\item{mutation_data}{A data frame with mutation information.}
}
\value{
A data frame with mutations spaced more than 1000 base pairs apart.
}
\description{
This function sorts a mutation data frame by chromosome and position,
and removes mutations that are less than 1000 base pairs apart to ensure
no mutations are closer than this threshold. It avoids duplicate read pairs
in the GRanges object, crucial for accurate genomic analysis. The threshold
was chosen based on the findings on kataegis, described as having an average
intermutation distance of â‰¤1000 bp in Alexandrov LB et al., Nature, 2013.

# Assuming df has columns 'chr' and 'pos'
